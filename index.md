## Questions
- **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
  -  The most interesting topic I covered in my domain this quarter was probably entailment/NLI.
- Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
  - One investigation I would like to pursue in more detail is document retrieval, which is key to implementing an effective entialment-based classifier for fact checking. Outside of entailment, I'd like to explore logical fallacy detection more. 
- What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
- What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
