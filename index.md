## Questions
- **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
  -  The most interesting topic I covered in my domain this quarter was probably entailment/NLI.
- Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
  - One investigation I would like to pursue in more detail is document retrieval, which is key to implementing an effective entialment-based classifier for fact checking. Outside of entailment, I'd like to explore logical fallacy detection more. 
- What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
  - One change I would make is to look for more data, both data with more observations and data that allows me to train more specific models.
- What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
  - I'm interested in experimenting with knowledge graphs. I've seen many successful implementation that use pre-existing knowledge graphs, but I'm interested in creating a specific knowledge graph that integrates knowledge relating to certain political entities and their pre-existing views and biases.
